# Productivity Dashboard
This is one of the big projects I'll make using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Sections
I plan on adding a navbar, that will navigate around the page, a header that'll greet user and show random motivational quotes, a to-do list of today's tasks, and may add more if i feel like it..

# Features
I plan on adding some animations, hover effects, theme switcher (dark or light mode) and many more!

# Theme 
The theme of the website will be aesthetic, cute and motivational - that'll make you motivated to do your tasks!

Now let's start with the design first! :)
Ok.. we'll deal with the design later, let's do coding first..!
