# Productivity Dashboard
This is one of the big projects I'll make using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- Sections <br>
I plan on adding a navbar, that will navigate around the page, a header that'll greet user and show random motivational quotes, a to-do list of today's tasks, and may add more if i feel like it..

- Features <br>
I plan on adding some animations, hover effects and many more!

- Theme <br>
The theme of the website will be aesthetic & motivational - that'll make you motivated to do your tasks!
